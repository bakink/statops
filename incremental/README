Is the incremental pref for an index inherited from the table?

There is no dbms_stats.set_index_prefs, but yet the pref can be 
retrieved with dbms_stats.get_prefs.

The answer is that to see the incremental you must get_prefs for a table.

See Oracle Note
  DBMS_STATS.SET_SCHEMA_PREFS does not feedback the current configuration values after setting it [ID 1338709.1]
